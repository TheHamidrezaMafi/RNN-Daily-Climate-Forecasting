# Daily Climate Forecasting

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting **mean atmospheric pressure** using historical climate data from **Delhi**. The goal is to explore and apply machine learning techniques—particularly **neural networks** designed for time-series prediction, including:

- Recurrent Neural Networks (**RNN**)
- Long Short-Term Memory networks (**LSTM**)
- Gated Recurrent Units (**GRU**)

All code and analysis are included in a single Jupyter notebook.
